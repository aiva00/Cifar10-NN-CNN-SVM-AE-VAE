# Cifar10-NN-CNN-SVM-AE-VAE
A project exploring and comparing different algorithms (and how to make them better) for the classification of the Cifar 10 dataset. Inside the notebooks exist only the general "templates". The results and findings of the numerous experiment are located in the corresponding reports. Unfortunately the work was originally done in Greek and the reports are auto-translated in English.

1st part:K nearest neighbors, K nearest Centroid --(notebook + report)

2nd part: Neural networks (multiple different examples), Convolutional neural networks, Autoencoders as feature extractors and for pretrain --(notebook + report)

3rd part: SVM (grid search for fine tuning), PCA, Autoencoders as a replace to PCA and Image reconstruction using PCA --(notebook + report)

4th part: Autoencoders, custom tf layers, training loops etc, Variational Autoencoders
