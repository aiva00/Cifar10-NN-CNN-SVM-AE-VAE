# Cifar10-NN-CNN-SVM-AE-VAE
A project exploring and comparing different algorithms (and how to make them better) for the classification of the Cifar 10 dataset. Inside the notebooks exist only the general "templates". The results of the numerous experiment are located in the corresponding reports. Unfortunately the work was originally done in Greek and the reports are auto-translated in English.
